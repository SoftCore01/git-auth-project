1.I just relaxed that files in a git repo vary from 
branch to branch. Some branches contain files some other
do not have. I just found this out while switching
from my master branch to my feature branch after I 
pushed changes to the master on github.

2.To pull changes from a particular branch run:
    git pull <remote> <branch>
     remote:repo url

3. Break down project using the following framework:
    a.Each feature is built on a single branch
    b.Each branch should be made from commits
    c.Each commit should be made after buildin
      a little portion of the feature without causing
      the application from crashing.
    
4.To rename a branch:
  locally: git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>
  remote:  git push origin -u <new-branch-name>

5.To delete a branch:
  locally: git branch -d <branch-name>
  remote: git push origin --delete <branch-name>

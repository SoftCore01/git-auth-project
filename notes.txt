1.I just relaxed that files in a git repo vary from 
branch to branch. Some branches contain files some other
do not have. I just found this out while switching
from my master branch to my feature branch after I 
pushed changes to the master on github.

2.To pull changes from a particular branch run:
    git pull <remote> <branch>
     remote:repo url
